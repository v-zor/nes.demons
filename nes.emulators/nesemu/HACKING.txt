Hacking Ideas - what you can doe with nesemu

. nes assembler (6502 processor) or machine code can be translated to e.g. 
 super nes assembler (65c816 processor) so it can be optimized to what 
 UNIX/Windows/Linux/POSIX systems call ELF (extended library format) assembler
output code (such as binutils's gas or gcc).
